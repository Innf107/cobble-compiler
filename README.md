# Cobble - A purely functional high level programming language that compiles to minecraft datapacks

## Quick Start
Right now, the only way to install cobble is by building from source.

### Prerequisites
To install cobble, you need to have [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) as well as [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) installed.

### Build steps
First, clone the repository. 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Innf107/cobble-compiler
```
If you do not have git installed, just download the repository by clicking on **Code -> Download ZIP** and unzip the archive.

Once you have cloned the repository, build and install the project using stack. (This might take a while)
```bash
$ stack install
